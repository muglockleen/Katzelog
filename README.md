# Katzelog

### Instructions for Running Katzelog
I'm still not knowledgeable enough about React and Node to know why, but you have to run `npm install` from the root directory after cloning and checking out the code. I guess this is normal?

### Basics
Katzelog is still incomplete so, for the most part, there is not much you can do other than see a short list of cats and click on each to view profiles. The accompanying JSON data and resource images for each cat are located in the project's data folder so there is no external database to use. JPGs are, therefore, CM'ed in this repository so that's not ideal, as binaries should not be CM'ed. I wasn't sure what the best practices are for storing binary resources for websites in a web code repo?

Miau!
